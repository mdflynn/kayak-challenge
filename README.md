# Kayak Challenge

---

## Overview

An app to display basic details about airlines!

Checkout it out at [Codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/kayak-challenge-wh5qf)

## Goals

- Create app according to provide wireframe.
- The page must behave responsively to accommodate smaller window widths so that the tiles in each row always fit in the window without being cut off. A mock up is provided showing an example of the grid within a smaller window.
- Each Airline tile should display the airline name and logo. On hover, more information about the airline should be displayed (Alliance name, phone number, & website).
- The Alliance filter above the tiles should filter the list of Airlines to only show Airlines matching the enabled filters if any are selected. If none are selected, the entire list should be shown.

  <summary>Set up</summary>

- Clone the repository down and cd into the repo on your local machine.
- Install the library dependencies by running:
  - `npm install`
- To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal.
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and the site should display and have functionality.
- Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Wins

- Getting the app to reflect the mockup was a great feeling!

- This was my first time working with `jsonp` and it was a good learning experience

## Challenges

- `jsonp` was a challenge at first but I found a great npm package that handled the fetching the data as fetch does not work with `jsonp`.

- Ambiguity with small site choices. The nav bottom border and airline url lengths were not explicitly defined. So making sure to make the best decision based on the wireframe took more time.
